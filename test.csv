We are a Bay Area startup (still in stealth mode) building a platform to democratize our legal system.  Too much of our legal system--including the forms we use for transacting even the most basic legal transactions--is fragmented and protected by artificial moats.  This prevents collaboration and drives up costs for everyone.  Legal documents should be collaborative and open source.  We are looking for a smart, energetic, adaptable full-stack engineer to help build out and launch the platform.  

No specific requirements on background or experience.  What is most important is that you are interested in the mission and are willing able to work hard, learn on the fly, and adapt.  For the right person, we are open to having you join as a co-founder (with commensurate equity).

Our founding team consists of lawyers and engineers trained at Stanford and other top schools, with deep experience in tech (both big tech cos. and startups) and legal (law firms and in-house).  Let us know if you'd like to join the team and help revolutionize our legal system.    ",,Significant equity and salary negotiable

Apply now at https://codefor.cash/pinchme-rubyist




    
        
            PINCHme.com Hiring Rails Developer
        
    
    
        
            PINCHme.com is a New York based company that operates a leading product sampling and digital promotions platform. PINCHme.com’s platform intelligently matches large Fast Moving Consumer Good (“FMCG”) brands with PINCHme.com’s own members, who are consumers that have provided PINCHme.com with comprehensive personal data about themselves and their spending habits. In return for the data they provide, PINCHme.com’s members receive free samples of products already available in-store or access to products ahead of their store release, while the FMCG brands receive detailed insights, product reviews and feedback and social media engagement, all of which assist in driving sales uplift.

        
    

    Company Size and Health
    
        
            The company's business model is innovative and produces true value. As the effectiveness of traditional mass marketing (tv, radio, print) declines, companies increasingly turn to innovative, smart providers like PINCHme to gain valuable insights from users in their target markets. PINCHme works with packaged goods companies and many of PINCHme's clients are household names such as as P&G, L’Oréal, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, Nestle Purina, Kellogg’s and Kraft.
            PINCHme’s office is located in Soho, NYC with a dynamic team of 35 young entrepreneurs and two playful dogs, Reggie and Gregory.
            As a software engineer, you will be eligible to participate in the company's staff equity plan, and PINCHme is publicly traded so its stock is  liquid. The company is profitable and has $4.3 million in revenue. PINCHme has been in business for six years.
            The following are some highlights from PINCHme's FY2018 performance:

            
                Members up 36% to 4.8 m
                Sampling programs up 35% to 123
                Data monetisation revenue up 136% to USD 4.1m (AUD 5.7m)
                Revenue up 18% to AUD 9.4m (AUD 13.0m)
            

            PINCHme is building one of the largest and most profiled
                consumer databases in the US in a very efficient way, by giving
                away free product samples, in exchange for members’ first party
                data.
                

            PINCHme’s community growth is highly correlated to the volume
                of samples distributed on a monthly basis, creating a very strong
                network effect – more samples, more members, more members,
                more data, more data, more monetisation. This is the reason why the company's
                immediate focus is not on profitability - they are intelligently trying to win the network effects race.

Software Product Engineer - Reinventing VC,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/d/san-francisco-software-product-engineer/6836784981.html,1552020120000, (financial district),"
        
We are NFX, a seed & series A venture fund based in San Francisco’s SOMA/Financial District (close to Montgomery BART).  We’re founded by four entrepreneurs who’ve started 10 technology companies that exited for over $10 billion. Now we’re building the venture firm we wish existed when we were running startups. A firm that runs like a software  company. 

We’ve invested in 230+ companies with network effects built into their DNA including Lyft, TRLA, Houzz, Poshmark, and Coinbase.

We did this in part by becoming students of and mastering network effects, which account for 70% of the value of creation in tech, and we’ve been engineering them into software from day one. Now we’re using this playbook again. Today as investors, we believe software will transform the venture capital industry and create a network effect VC model.

Venture capital is a “people business”, but we’re certain that software will radically change how innovation is funded and supported in the next 10 years. There is a huge opportunity for you to build software to help founders   gain their competitive edge with fundraising, hiring, and knowledge transfer, and by opening many of our tools to the entire tech community, we’re  making an impact that is global. 

This role is designed for top software engineers  to learn how network effects work, get a front row seat to how high-caliber investors make decisions, and to build things from day one that will make a difference in how all Founders are funded and supported.

In this role, on any given day you will: 

1. Build. You will own product development from idea to ship. You will work across our technologies, whether it be scaling how we handle exponentially growing data sets of the Signal founder-VC network, researching and implementing latest ML/AI technologies into our VC AI, or developing a MVP of a new product to test. 

2. Learn. You will be a student of network effects (nfx). Very few understand how they actually work, and in this role, you  you’ll have a front row seat into nfx, and will also gain a deep understanding of the relationship dynamics & nuances of the founder/VC ecosystem. You will work alongside founders and VCs, attend pitch and partner meetings, and collaborate with our team of entrepreneurs and operators. 

3. Impact. You will be transforming a largely analog industry into one that is more efficient and effective, powered by software you create. 

Who you are:  

An engineer who has been coding professionally for 4+ years, prefers full-stack development and takes the pragmatic approach to software engineering. This is not a role for engineers who prefer just backend, frontend, or are dogmatic about using specific language, frameworks, and tools. Our stack is GraphQL/Apollo, React, Ruby/Rails, Redux.

You want to be 100% immersed in tackling these challenging human problems with code, and you want to play an active role in determining product direction.This is not a role for engineers who want to code to spec.

You’re looking for a full-time job in San Francisco with competitive comp, full benefits, and a small close-knit team of passionate colleagues changing how founders are funded and supported. This is not a side hustle.

Software Product Engineer - Reinventing VC,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/d/san-francisco-software-product-engineer/6828178776.html,1551076140000, (financial district),"
        
We are NFX, a seed & series A venture fund based in San Francisco’s SOMA/Financial District (close to Montgomery BART).  We’re founded by four entrepreneurs who’ve started 10 technology companies that exited for over $10 billion. Now we’re building the venture firm we wish existed when we were running startups. A firm that runs like a software  company. 

We’ve invested in 230+ companies with network effects built into their DNA including Lyft, Houzz, Poshmark, and Coinbase.

We did this in part by becoming students of and mastering network effects, which account for 70% of the value of creation in tech, and we’ve been engineering them into software from day one. Now we’re using this playbook again. Today as investors, we believe software will transform the venture capital industry and create a network effect VC model.

Venture capital is a “people business”, but we’re certain that software will radically change how innovation is funded and supported in the next 10 years. There is a huge opportunity for you to build software to help founders   gain their competitive edge with fundraising, hiring, and knowledge transfer, and by opening many of our tools to the entire tech community, we’re  making an impact that is global. 

This role is designed for top software engineers  to learn how network effects work, get a front row seat to how high-caliber investors make decisions, and to build things from day one that will make a difference in how all Founders are funded and supported.

As a Product Engineer, you will: 

1. Build. You will own product development from idea to ship. You will work across our technologies, whether it be scaling how we handle exponentially growing data sets of the Signal founder-VC network, researching and implementing latest ML/AI technologies into our VC AI, or developing a MVP of a new product to test. 

2. Learn. You will be a student of network effects (nfx). Very few understand how they actually work, and in this role, you  you’ll have a front row seat into nfx, and will also gain a deep understanding of the relationship dynamics & nuances of the founder/VC ecosystem. You will work alongside founders and VCs, attend pitch and partner meetings, and collaborate with our team of entrepreneurs and operators. 

3. Impact. You will be transforming a largely analog industry into one that is more efficient and effective, powered by software you create. 

Who you are:  

An engineer who has been coding professionally for 4+ years, prefers full-stack development and takes the pragmatic approach to software engineering. This is not a role for engineers who prefer just backend, frontend, or are dogmatic about using specific language, frameworks, and tools. Our stack is GraphQL/Apollo, React, Ruby/Rails, Redux.

You want to be 100% immersed in tackling these challenging human problems with code, and you want to play an active role in determining product direction.This is not a role for engineers who want to code to spec.

You’re looking for a full-time job in San Francisco with competitive comp, full benefits, and a small close-knit team of passionate colleagues changing how founders are funded and supported. This is not a side hustle.
